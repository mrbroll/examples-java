##Examples_Java

These are just simple code examples that I play around with for learning new techniques, libraries, or tools specific to java.

Each directory in this repo is a different project. I'm a pretty big gradle fan, so these will all probably be gradle projects, so everything can be built with a simple:

    ./gradlew build

I don't use an IDE. If you do, you might have to perform some additional setup, but I think gradle plays nicely with IntelliJ and Eclipse either OOB or, at most, with a plugin.
